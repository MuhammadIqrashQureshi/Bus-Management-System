# Bus-Management-System
Efficio - Bus Management System is a Java-based desktop application developed to simplify and automate bus reservation and management processes. Built with a user-friendly JavaFX interface, it supports three different user roles i.e. passengers, station manager, and administrators each with tailored functionalities. Key features include ticket pre-booking and booking, bus schedule viewing, and feedback submission. The backend logic is implemented in Java, with persistent data storage handled by a MySQL database. The entire system was carefully planned and modeled using UML diagrams before development began. These include Domain Model, System Sequence Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Class Diagram, Use Case Diagram, Deployment Diagram, Component Diagram and Package Diagram ensuring strong software design principles following GRASP. This structured approach allowed for a modular, maintainable and extensible architecture.
